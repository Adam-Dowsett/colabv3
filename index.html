        <h1>Genin</h1>
        <p>Genin is the lowest rank of ninja class, but of course only in the chain of command. The Genin were highly trained ninjas, capable of feats of great stealth and espionage. Trained from childhood, the Genin were taught the ways of the Ninja, knowing one day they might be called to action. Whether called to perform an assassination, garner information or research, the Genin were more than capable of dropping the chores of their daily life to spring into action.</p>
        <p>The Genin in their daily life however typically filled traditional roles in the community. Farmers, teachers, or tradesmen, the Genin would even take roles in enemy territory, performing espionage from the inside of their foes land.</p>

        <h1>Chunin</h1>
        <p>The Chunin was the middle man in the system, the go-between from the Jonin to the Genin. While the Jonin made the necessary decisions to protect the community, the Chunin was the contact the Jonin went too. Once the Chunin was briefed on the mission they would go to the grass roots level assigning the mission to a suitable Genin.</p>

        <h1>Jonin</h1>
